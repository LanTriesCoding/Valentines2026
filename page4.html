                        If you clicked the link enthuasiastically, you'll already have noticed... that there's somewhat of a message with the song titles...
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        The top two songs in the playlist have the exact word-for-word meaning of what I wish to express and be understood..
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        I want to repeat to you as many times as there are of "wanna be yours" line, and I want to sing to you genuine praises of how you're the best girl just as many times as "more than you know"
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        I'm still in shock how my most two favorite picks are in complete sync with their titles. The sheer luck?
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        The last two songs are in Japanese, but you need not freak out, my love. I put them last because their titles don't match with my message - they cover the vibes more than enough.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        Until I Found You... That's the song made me realize I'm in love with you. I still remember my heart shaking as clear as day... I still do whenever I think of how much I love you and how I wanna pamper you...
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        You have no idea how much I like Way Back Home, baby. You have absolutely no idea. Watch out, and start worrying about getting squeezed to death once you find me in the song's mood... /cough
